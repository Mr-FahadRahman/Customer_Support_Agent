# Customer Support Agent with LangGraph and DeepSeek-R1 LLM

## Introduction

This project showcases an AI-driven customer support agent built using **LangGraph** and **DeepSeek LLM** (via **Groq**). The system efficiently handles customer queries by categorizing them, analyzing sentiment, generating appropriate responses, and escalating critical cases when needed.

## Why This Project?

Businesses often struggle with handling large volumes of customer queries efficiently. Automating the initial support stages can significantly improve response times and user satisfaction. By leveraging **DeepSeek LLM**, a powerful and cost-effective AI model, this project eliminates the need for expensive proprietary solutions while maintaining high-quality responses.

## Core Features

- ✅ **Structured State Management** – Tracks query details, category, sentiment, and response.
- ✅ **Query Categorization** – Classifies queries into **Technical**, **Billing**, or **General** for accurate routing.
- ✅ **Sentiment Analysis** – Detects whether a query is **Positive**, **Neutral**, or **Negative** for better engagement.
- ✅ **AI-Powered Responses** – Uses **DeepSeek LLM** via **Groq** to generate context-aware replies.
- ✅ **Smart Escalation** – Automatically directs **Negative Sentiment** queries to human agents.
- ✅ **Graph-Based Workflow** – Implements **LangGraph** for a structured and extensible support pipeline.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Defining State Structure**  
   A `TypedDict` is used to manage customer interaction data.

2. **LLM Integration**  
   **DeepSeek LLM** via **Groq** is used for natural language processing to generate responses.

3. **Categorization & Sentiment Analysis**  
   AI models classify and analyze customer queries into appropriate categories and detect their sentiment.

4. **Workflow Design**  
   **LangGraph’s StateGraph** connects different processing stages in a structured way.

5. **Routing Logic**  
   Queries are directed based on **category** (Technical, Billing, General) and **sentiment** (Positive, Neutral, Negative).

6. **Execution & Testing**  
   The system processes customer interactions in real-time to ensure smooth operation.

## Final Thoughts

This customer support agent provides fast, intelligent, and automated responses while ensuring critical cases are escalated when needed. The graph-based AI workflow makes the system modular, scalable, and easily adaptable for different business needs, from chatbots to enterprise customer service solutions.
